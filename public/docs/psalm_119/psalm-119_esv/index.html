51 The insolent utterly deride me, but I do not turn away from your law.<br>
52 When I think of your rules from of old, I take comfort, O Lord.<br>
53 Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked, who forsake your law.<br>
54 Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my sojourning.<br>
55 I remember your name in the night, O Lord, and keep your law.<br>

84 How long must your servant endure?[g] When will you judge those who persecute me?<br>
85 The insolent have dug pitfalls for me; they do not live according to your law.<br>
86 All your commandments are sure; they persecute me with falsehood; help me!<br>
87 They have almost made an end of me on earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts.<br>
88 In your steadfast love give me life, that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth.</p>
<h2 id="12-lamedh">12 Lamedh</h2>

108 Accept my freewill offerings of praise, O Lord, and teach me your rules.<br>
109 I hold my life in my hand continually, but I do not forget your law.<br>
110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, but I do not stray from your precepts.<br>
111 Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart.<br>
