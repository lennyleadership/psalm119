## 和合本

89 耶和华啊，你的话安定在天，直到永远。  
90 你的诚实存到万代；你坚定了地，地就长存。  
91 天地照你的安排存到今日；万物都是你的仆役。  
92 我若不是喜爱你的律法，早就在苦难中灭绝了！  
93 我永不忘记你的训词，因你用这训词将我救活了。  
94 我是属你的，求你救我，因我寻求了你的训词。  
95 恶人等待我，要灭绝我，我却要揣摩你的法度。  
96 我看万事尽都有限，惟有你的命令极其宽广。  


## ESV
**Lamedh**
89 Forever, O Lord, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens.  
90 Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast.  
91 By your appointment they stand this day, for all things are your servants.  
92 If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction.  
93 I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life.  
94 I am yours; save me, for I have sought your precepts.  
95 The wicked lie in wait to destroy me, but I consider your testimonies.  
96 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commandment is exceedingly broad.
