## 和合本

81 我心渴想你的救恩，仰望你的应许。  
82 我因盼望你的应许眼睛失明，说：你何时安慰我？  
83 我好像烟薰的皮袋，却不忘记你的律例。  
84 你仆人的年日有多少呢？你几时向逼迫我的人施行审判呢？  
85 不从你律法的骄傲人为我掘了坑。  
86 你的命令尽都诚实；他们无理地逼迫我，求你帮助我！  
87 他们几乎把我从世上灭绝，但我没有离弃你的训词。  
88 求你照你的慈爱将我救活，我就遵守你口中的法度。  

## ESV
**Kaph**
81 My soul longs for your salvation; I hope in your word.  
82 My eyes long for your promise; I ask, “When will you comfort me?”  
83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I have not forgotten your statutes.  
84 How long must your servant endure?[g] When will you judge those who persecute me?  
85 The insolent have dug pitfalls for me; they do not live according to your law.  
86 All your commandments are sure; they persecute me with falsehood; help me!  
87 They have almost made an end of me on earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts.  
88 In your steadfast love give me life, that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth.  


## Meditation 默想

    78  愿骄傲人蒙羞，因为他们无理地倾覆我；但我要思想你的训词。   
    78  Let the insolent be put to shame, because they have wronged me with falsehood; as for me, I will meditate on your precepts.   

    83 我好像烟薰的皮袋，却不忘记你的律例。    
    83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I have not forgotten your statutes.    

    这两处的经文表达出作者身处难堪处境时，作者的情绪跌落到低谷。然而画风并没有消沉，而是把我们对上帝话语的渴慕带向至高处。我们的情绪也被提振起来。  

    我把这两处经文与新约的几处经文联系起来思想。  

    太16：24 于是耶稣对门徒说：「若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。  
    (Matthew 16:24)  Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.  

    约10：10 我来了，是要叫羊得生命，并且得的更丰盛。   
    (John 10:10)  The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.  

    约12：26 若有人服事我，就当跟从我；我在哪里，服事我的人也要在那里；若有人服事我，我父必尊重他。  
    (John 12:26)  If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.  

    启14：4  这些人未曾沾染妇女，他们原是童身。羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随他。他们是从人间买来的，作初熟的果子归与上帝和羔羊。  
    (Revelation 14:4)  It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb,  

    诗篇119在这里有异曲同工的效果。虽然我们看到这篇诗篇整章是在讲要遵循上帝的话语，其实是要鼓励读者作一个跟随上帝的人。一个跟随上帝的人必定会听上帝的话。哪怕是最糟糕的环境下，也相信上帝，跟随上帝。
