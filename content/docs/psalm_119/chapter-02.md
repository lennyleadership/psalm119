## 和合本
9 少年人用什么洁净他的行为呢？是要遵行你的话！  
10 我一心寻求了你；求你不要叫我偏离你的命令。  
11 我将你的话藏在心里，免得我得罪你。  
12 耶和华啊，你是应当称颂的！求你将你的律例教训我！  
13 我用嘴唇传扬你口中的一切典章。  
14我喜悦你的法度，如同喜悦一切的财物。  
15我要默想你的训词，看重你的道路。  
16我要在你的律例中自乐；我不忘记你的话。  


## ESV
**Beth**  
9 How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word.  
10 With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments!  
11 I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.  
12 Blessed are you, O Lord; teach me your statutes!  
13 With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth.  
14 In the way of your testimonies I delight as much as in all riches.  
15 I will meditate on your precepts and fix my eyes on your ways.  
16 I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word.
