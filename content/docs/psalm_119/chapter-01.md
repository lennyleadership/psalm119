## 和合本
1 行为完全、遵行耶和华律法的，这人便为有福！  
2 遵守他的法度、一心寻求他的，这人便为有福！  
3 这人不做非义的事，但遵行他的道。  
4 耶和华啊，你曾将你的训词吩咐我们，为要我们殷勤遵守。  
5 但愿我行事坚定，得以遵守你的律例。  
6 我看重你的一切命令，就不至于羞愧。
7 我学了你公义的判语，就要以正直的心称谢你。  
8 我必守你的律例；求你总不要丢弃我！    

## ESV  
1 Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord!  
2 Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart,  
3 who also do no wrong, but walk in his ways!  
4 You have commanded your precepts to be kept diligently.  
5 Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping your statutes!  
6 Then I shall not be put to shame, having my eyes fixed on all your commandments.  
7 I will praise you with an upright heart, when I learn your righteous rules.  
8 I will keep your statutes; do not utterly forsake me!
