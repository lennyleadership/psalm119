## 和合本
1 行为完全、遵行耶和华律法的，这人便为有福！  
2 遵守他的法度、一心寻求他的，这人便为有福！  
3 这人不做非义的事，但遵行他的道。  
4 耶和华啊，你曾将你的训词吩咐我们，为要我们殷勤遵守。  
5 但愿我行事坚定，得以遵守你的律例。  
6 我看重你的一切命令，就不至于羞愧。  
7 我学了你公义的判语，就要以正直的心称谢你。  
8 我必守你的律例；求你总不要丢弃我！    

## ESV  
1 Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law of the Lord!  
2 Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart,  
3 who also do no wrong, but walk in his ways!  
4 You have commanded your precepts to be kept diligently.  
5 Oh that my ways may be steadfast in keeping your statutes!  
6 Then I shall not be put to shame, having my eyes fixed on all your commandments.   
7 I will praise you with an upright heart, when I learn your righteous rules.  
8 I will keep your statutes; do not utterly forsake me!  

## Meditation 默想
7 我学了你公义的判语，就要以正直的心称谢你。(和合本） 

7 I will give thanks to You with an upright heart, When I learn [through discipline] Your righteous judgments [for my transgressions]. （AMP version)  

若有人被逆境击垮，很能理解。若有人能逆境飞扬，鲜有人能做得到。若有人像约伯一样说：  

伯 42:1  约伯回答耶和华说：    
伯 42:2  我知道，你万事都能做；你的旨意不能拦阻。   
伯 42:3  谁用无知的言语使你的旨意隐藏呢？我所说的是我不明白的；这些事太奇妙，是我不知道的。   
伯 42:4  求你听我，我要说话；我问你，求你指示我。   
伯 42:5  我从前风闻有你，现在亲眼看见你。   
伯 42:6  因此我厌恶自己（或作：我的言语），在尘土和炉灰中懊悔。   

AMP Version  
Job 42:1  Then Job answered the LORD and said,   
Job 42:2  "I know that You can do all things, And that no thought or purpose of Yours can be restrained.   
Job 42:3  "[You said to me] 'Who is this that darkens and obscures counsel [by words] without knowledge?' Therefore [I now see] I have [rashly] uttered that which I did not understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. [Job_38:2]   
Job 42:4  'Hear, please, and I will speak; I will ask You, and You instruct [and answer] me.'   
Job 42:5  "I had heard of You [only] by the hearing of the ear, But now my [spiritual] eye sees You.   
Job 42:6  "Therefore I retract [my words and hate myself] And I repent in dust and ashes."   

这人一定认识了上帝，还学会了在各样处境中赞美上帝。
