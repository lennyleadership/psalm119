## 和合本

73  你的手制造我，建立我；求你赐我悟性，可以学习你的命令！  
74  敬畏你的人见我就要欢喜，因我仰望你的话。  
75  耶和华啊，我知道你的判语是公义的；你使我受苦是以诚实待我。  
76  求你照着应许仆人的话，以慈爱安慰我。  
77  愿你的慈悲临到我，使我存活，因你的律法是我所喜爱的。  
78  愿骄傲人蒙羞，因为他们无理地倾覆我；但我要思想你的训词。  
79  愿敬畏你的人归向我，他们就知道你的法度。  
80  愿我的心在你的律例上完全，使我不致蒙羞。  

## ESV
**Yodh**  
73  Your hands have made and fashioned me; give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.  
74  Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice, because I have hoped in your word.  
75  I know, O Lord, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me.  
76  Let your steadfast love comfort me according to your promise to your servant.  
77  Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight.  
78  Let the insolent be put to shame, because they have wronged me with falsehood; as for me, I will meditate on your precepts.  
79  Let those who fear you turn to me, that they may know your testimonies.  
80  May my heart be blameless in your statutes, that I may not be put to shame!
