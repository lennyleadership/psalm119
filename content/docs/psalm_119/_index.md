收集整理了灵修诗篇119篇的点滴想法。  

This is the collection of my meditation on Psalm 119.


## 遵守上帝话语相关经文  
(约一 2:3-6)  
<sup>3</sup> 我们若遵守他的诫命，就晓得是认识他。  
^4 人若说「我认识他」，却不遵守他的诫命，便是说谎话的，真理也不在他心里了。   
^5 凡遵守主道的，爱上帝的心在他里面实在是完全的。从此，我们知道我们是在主里面。   
^6 人若说他住在主里面，就该自己照主所行的去行。  

(1 John 2:3-6)   
^3 And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.   
^4 Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,   
^5 but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected.   
^6 By this we may know that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.

### 默想：  
世上只有一个人可以说他遵守了主的道，并且上帝的爱在他里面是完全的，那人就是耶稣。
